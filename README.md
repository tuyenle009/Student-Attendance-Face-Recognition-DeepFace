ðŸš€ Project Highlights

Advanced Face Recognition: Utilizes YOLOv11l and DeepFace to detect and identify faces with high precision, assigning unique IDs to each student using DeepSort for robust tracking.
Two Powerful Modes:
Single-Person Voting Mode: Perfect for one-by-one check-ins, this mode uses a voting mechanism to ensure accurate attendance marking.
Multi-Person Video Mode: Designed for high-angle video feeds, this mode can track and identify multiple students simultaneously, ideal for large groups.


Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit, the user-friendly UI makes attendance management a breeze for educators.
Accuracy-Driven: Calculates confidence scores (accuracy) for each identified face based on IDs, with potential for enhanced voting-based attendance.
